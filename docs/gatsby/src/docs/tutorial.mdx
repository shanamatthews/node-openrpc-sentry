# Advanced Query tutorial: Get transaction history for an Ethereum address

QT's Advanced Query APIs (preview) allow you to simplify and optimize common request types to make developing on the blockchain easier.

In this tutorial you will get the full transaction history for a smart contract or a user address including external, internal, token, ERC-20 and ERC-721 token transfers in a single request.

Why get address transaction history by an address?
- Display a user's full transaction history
- Query an address's transactions filtered by smart contract interactions 
- Analyze a user's historical profit and loss

## Prerequisites

- A Coinbase Cloud account with access to the preview
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) installed

## Create a project and get API keys

To get started using the new Query & Transact Advanced Query preview APIs, sign in to your Coinbase Cloud account:

<img src="/sign-in.png" alt="Sign in to Coinbase Cloud Console screen" width="60%" class="ImageBorder" />

### Create project

After you sign in you'll be prompted to set up your first project. A project provides access to a shared node (Ethereum Mainnet only for preview) where you can make Ethereum calls and calls to the Advanced Query APIs. 

Select the Free tier plan (Free-tier only for preview) and enter a name for your project.

<img src="/create-project.png" alt="Create a project screen" width="60%" class="ImageBorder" />

### Get API keys

After creating a project, you'll be taken to the project overview page. 

  <img src="/project-overview.png" alt="Create a project screen" width="60%" class="ImageBorder" />

This page gives key information about your project, including:
- Endpoint
- API Access Token Username (e.g. username)
- API Access Token Password (e.g. password)

Copy your endpoint, username, and password to your machine. 

> ⚠️ You can return to this page to retrieve your endpoint and username, but your password is **not saved**. 
>
> **If you lose your project password, you will need to create a new project.**

## Make a request and process the response

Now, you will use the information you copied to make a request to the Advanced Query APIs.

### Make request

Open your terminal and run the following command, replacing `username`, and `password` with the values you copied from the Console. 

For preview, the API endpoint is the same across all projects.

```json
curl https://2f9c52e0-c2db-4687-b81c-67e834fe65f5.ethereum.bison.run \
  -u username:password \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "method": "coinbaseCloud_getTransactionsByAddress",
  "params": {
    "address": "0x3cd751e6b0078be393132286c442345e5dc49699",
    "blockStart": 14431488,
    "blockEnd": 14431489,
    "addressFilter": "SENDER",
    "blockchain": "Ethereum",
    "network":"Mainnet"
  },
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0"
}'
```

This call to `getTransactionsByAddress` specifies:

|param|value|explanation|
|-|-|-|
|`address`|`"0x3cd751e6b0078be393132286c442345e5dc49699"`|the Ethereum address you're retrieving transactions for|
|`blockStart`|`14431488`|the block number to start scanning for transactions|
|`blockEnd`|`14431489`|the block number to stop scanning for transactions. Optional, defaults the the latest block|
|`addressFilter`|`"SENDER"`|filters returned transactions to sender or reciever if specified. Optional, defaults to `"SENDER_OR_RECEIVER"`|
|`blockchain`|`"Ethereum"`|Ethereum-only in preview. Optional, defaults to `"Ethereum"`|
|`network`|`"Mainnet"`|Mainnet-only in preview. Optional, defaults to `"Mainnet"`|


### Get the response

You should get a JSON response back that looks similar to this:

```json

                "value": "157704540000000000"
              }
            ]
          },
          {
            "...": "output omitted"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "...": "output omitted"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Understand the response

This response gives a list of blocks in which transactions were found. Each block includes the list of external transactions found for that address in that block. Since we specified `"SENDER"`, the returned transactions will include only those which the specified address was the sender.

Here is all the information returned from the call.

- `blockStart`: the block number this response starts at
- `blockEnd`: the block number this response ends at
  - If >1000 transactions would be returned for the requested block range, this API will return 
  - up to 1000 transactions in a smaller block range, specified in the result
  - OR all the transactions in a single block if the number in that block > 1000
  - [See API docs](https://main.d11a9x012jyl0p.amplifyapp.com/api-documentation/) for more details on pagination
- `blocks`: the list of blocks containing transactions:
  - `blockHash`: the block's hashed identifier
  - `blockNumber`: this specific block's number
  - `blockTimestamp`: the date and time this block was mined
  - `transactions`: a list of relevant transactions in this block
  - `transactionHash`: the transaction's identifying hash
  - `transactionIndex`: the transaction's index in the block
  - `from`: origin address
  - `to`: destination address
  - `value`: value in native blockchain currency
  - `gasLimit`: the transaction's gas set limit
  - `gasPrice`: the transaction's price per unit of gas
  - `gasUsed`: the amount of gas actually used for the transaction
  - `status`: "1" for success, "0" for failure
  - `input`: input data to the transaction
  - `nonce`: the transaction's nonce
  - `blockHash`: the block's hashed identifier (same data as in `block` object)
  - `blockNumber`: this specific block's number (same data as in `block` object)
  - `blockTimestamp`: the date and time this block was mined (same data as in `block` object)
  - `internalTransactions`: associated messages carried out by a smart contract, if any
    - `traceType`: type of internal transaction, e.g. `CREATE`, `CALL`, `CALLCODE`, `DELEGATECALL`, `SUICIDE`
    - `from`: origin address
    - `to`: destination address
    - `value`: value in native blockchain currency
  - `tokenTransfers`: associated token transfers, if any
    - `tokenAddress`: address location for the token contract
    - `tokenType`: "erc20" or "erc721" (ERC-20 and ERC-721 are the only types support for preview)
    - `from`: origin address
    - `to`: destination address
    - `value`: for ERC-20, gives quantity of tokens transferred, for ERC-721 gives list of token IDs transferred


### Process the response

For a given purpose, we may only be interested in a small subset of this information. Let's use the command line utility, `jq` to get the recipient of each top level transaction.

To save us from making more API calls, save the response to a file called **response.json** by copying and pasting from your terminal, or running the following command:

```json
curl https://2f9c52e0-c2db-4687-b81c-67e834fe65f5.ethereum.bison.run \
  -u <username>:<password> \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
  -d '{
  "method": "coinbaseCloud_getTransactionsByAddress",
  "params": {
    "address": "0x3cd751e6b0078be393132286c442345e5dc49699",
    "blockStart": 14431488,
    "blockEnd": 14431489,
    "addressFilter": "SENDER",
    "blockchain": "Ethereum",
    "network":"Mainnet"
  },
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0"
}' | jq '.' > response.json
```

Note that command piped the response to `jq '.'`. This will ensure the json response is nicely formatted in your file.

Next, run this command to get the recipient (`to`) and amount (`value`) of each top-level transaction: 

```shell
cat response.json | jq '.result.blocks[].transactions[] | {to: .to, value: .value }'
```

**Output:**

```json
{
  "to": "0x912a523a10e052900b571889b07ff4f2fd86e029",
  "value": "157704540000000000"
}
{
  "to": "0x3f54e2d84e42b113af00ab489c01adb0c5cf62d2",
  "value": "24776000000000000"
}
{
  "to": "0x912a523a10e052900b571889b07ff4f2fd86e029",
  "value": "157704540000000000"
}
{
  "to": "0x3f54e2d84e42b113af00ab489c01adb0c5cf62d2",
  "value": "24776000000000000"
}
{
  "to": "0x912a523a10e052900b571889b07ff4f2fd86e029",
  "value": "157704540000000000"
}
{
  "to": "0x3f54e2d84e42b113af00ab489c01adb0c5cf62d2",
  "value": "24776000000000000"
}
{
  "to": "0x912a523a10e052900b571889b07ff4f2fd86e029",
  "value": "157704540000000000"
}
{
  "to": "0x3f54e2d84e42b113af00ab489c01adb0c5cf62d2",
  "value": "24776000000000000"
}
{
  "to": "0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7",
  "value": "0"
}
{
  "to": "0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7",
  "value": "0"
}
{
  "to": "0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7",
  "value": "0"
}
{
  "to": "0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7",
  "value": "0"
}
```

Now we can see what addresses our input address has been sending transactions to and the value of those transactions. 

You now know how to get transaction history for a given Ethereum address! From here, you can process more information from your response or check out other [Advanced Query APIs]((https://main.d11a9x012jyl0p.amplifyapp.com/api-documentation/)).
